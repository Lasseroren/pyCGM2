# How to read the documentation


The API documentation was designed to satisfy analysts with different experience in python programming.


## Analyst with no experience in python programming


**Non python programmer** would be more interested in the [executables](Pages/Executables.md)] scripts.

* Open an anaconda prompt
* activate your virtual environment
* then type the name of the executable.

check out a [Vicon example](https://pycgm2.netlify.app/code/apps/vicon-apps/cgm1) or [QTM example](https://pycgm2.netlify.app/code/apps/qtm-apps) from the project website

## Novice

By novice, we assume you can :

 * edit a simple script
 * know how to call a function
 * run a python script   

In this case, we encourage novice to check out the [high-level functions](Pages/Lib.md)]

 ```{note}
the novice can visit the section [work with the API](https://pycgm2.netlify.app/code/apps/vicon-apps/cgm1) to find out explicit example        
 ```

## Developer

Developer can consult the [modules](Pages/Core.md) section to deep into th content of the pyCGM2 package.
